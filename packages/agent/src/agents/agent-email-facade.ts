/**
 * Notifications v2 (EW-650 / EW-670) — token + contract for the Agent
 * `sendEmail` (T23) and `messageAgent` (T24) tools.
 *
 * Same circular-dep dodge as `agent-git-facade.ts`: the
 * `agent-tool.service.ts` injects this via `@Optional() @Inject(AGENT_EMAIL_FACADE)`
 * so unit tests + non-API contexts can build the descriptor list
 * without a runtime `EmailFacadeService` dependency. The platform-side
 * adapter forwards to `EmailFacadeService` (packages/agent/src/facades/email.facade.ts),
 * resolving the Agent's outbound assignment + tenant address.
 *
 * When the token is unbound the tools are simply omitted from the
 * Agent's descriptor list — the model never sees them.

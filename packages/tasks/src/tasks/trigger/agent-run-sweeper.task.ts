/**
 * Stuck-run sweep for `agent_runs`.
 *
 * A worker killed without reaching any checkpoint — OOM, node eviction,
 * deploy, Trigger.dev teardown — leaves its row in `queued`/`running` forever.
 * Nothing reaped it: `AgentScheduleDispatcherService.recoverStuckRunning()`
 * sweeps `agents` rows only. The stranded row then keeps
 * `findInFlightForTaskAgent` reporting an in-flight run, which permanently
 * suppresses dispatch for that task-agent pair.
 *
 * Its own schedule rather than a step inside the heartbeat dispatcher, mirroring
 * `kb-reconcile` (the same job for a different table). Three reasons:
 *
 *   1. The dispatcher runs every minute against a multi-hour cutoff — ~360x
 *      more often than useful.
 *   2. `agent-heartbeat-dispatcher` has no upper clamp on its interval, so a
 *      large `AGENT_DISPATCH_INTERVAL_MINUTES` would silently disable a
 *      piggybacked sweep.
 *   3. A reap is a signal that something upstream died. Buried inside one of
 *      ~1440 daily dispatcher ticks it is invisible; with its own task id it
 *      has its own run history.
 *
 * It also keeps firing when `AGENTS_DISPATCHER_ENABLED=false`, which is exactly
 * when rows are most likely to be stranded.
 *
 * Cron offset off the hour, per the `kb-reconcile` rationale, so it does not
 * collide with `anonymous-user-cleanup` (03:17) or the per-minute crons. Every
 * 2h against a multi-hour cutoff bounds detection lag to `cutoff + 2h`.

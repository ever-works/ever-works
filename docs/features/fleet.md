# Fleet

**Fleet** is the registry of machines that belong to you — the [Desktop App](./desktop-app.md) on your laptop, a headless node on a box you own, or the nodes of a Kubernetes cluster you configured. It is how the platform knows what compute you have, without you opening a port.

## Two kinds of node

| Kind           | How it appears                                                           | `persisted` |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| `desktop-node` | The Desktop App, enrolled with a one-time token.                         | `true`      |
| `node`         | A headless node app, enrolled the same way.                              | `true`      |
| Cluster nodes  | Nodes of _your own_ configured cluster, merged in live and never stored. | `false`     |

Cluster nodes are read live from the cluster you configured; the platform's own managed cluster is excluded by a sentinel so you never see infrastructure that is not yours.

Enrolled nodes go **offline** after five minutes without a heartbeat.

## Enrolling a node

Enrollment is outbound-only: the node calls the platform, never the other way round. Nothing needs to be reachable from the internet.

1. **Mint a token** — **Settings → Fleet → Add node**, or

    ```
    POST /api/fleet/nodes/enrollment-token   { "name": "Mac mini", "kind": "node" }
    → { node, token, expiresInSec }
    ```

    The token is shown **exactly once** and only its SHA-256 is stored. It is single-use and expires in 15 minutes.

2. **Hand it to the node** — the node app calls the public route with the token as its credential:

    ```
    POST /api/fleet/enroll   { "token": "…", "platform": "linux/x64",
                               "version": "1.0.0", "capabilities": ["terminal","workspace"] }
    → { nodeId, secret, node }
    ```

    The heartbeat `secret` is likewise returned exactly once and stored only as a hash.

3. **The node reports in** — periodically:

    ```
    POST /api/fleet/heartbeat   { "nodeId": "…", "secret": "…", "capabilities": [...] }
    → { ok: true, node }
    ```

    Last-seen is **server-stamped**; a node never supplies its own clock.

Every invalid credential path — unknown token, expired token, already-consumed token, unknown node, wrong secret — answers one undifferentiated `401`. The response never says which check failed.

## Managing nodes

```
GET    /api/fleet/nodes        list mine (enrolled + live own-cluster)
PATCH  /api/fleet/nodes/:id    { name?, disabled? }
DELETE /api/fleet/nodes/:id    remove the registration
```

**Disabling drains.** A disabled node's heartbeats stop being accepted, so it goes quiet immediately rather than at the next sweep. Re-enabling puts it back to `offline` until its next accepted heartbeat proves it alive. Disabling a node that is still `enrolling` revokes its unused token.

Everything here is owner-scoped: another account's node id is indistinguishable from one that does not exist.

## Capabilities

A node advertises capability tags (up to 16) such as `terminal`, `workspace` or `docker`. These describe what the node can host.

> **Status.** Enrollment, heartbeats, the registry and the Fleet settings page are shipped. Scheduling Tasks _onto_ an enrolled node needs the node worker host, which is on the roadmap — until it lands, Fleet is an accurate inventory of your machines rather than a scheduling target.

# Tenants & Organizations — Implementation Plan

**Status:** Draft v1 · **Owner:** Engineering · **Date:** 2026-05-27
**Spec:** [spec.md](spec.md) · **Tasks:** [tasks.md](tasks.md) · **Acceptance:** [acceptance.md](acceptance.md)

> This plan is **additive**. Every step adds a column, a table, an endpoint, or a UI surface. Nothing existing is removed, renamed, or refactored. Existing users keep working without any data migration applied to them — they simply have `tenantId = NULL` until they create their first Organization.

The plan is **10 phases**. Each phase is a JIRA Story (Story keys assigned at ticket creation — see [tasks.md](tasks.md) for the linkage). Each phase ships as one PR against `develop` unless noted.

## Phase 0 — Username uniqueness contract (foundation)

**Goal:** Make `users.username` uniqueness an enforced DB-level contract before anything else relies on it for slug routing.

**Changes:**

1. New TypeORM migration: `AddUniqueIndexToUsername`.
   - Pre-check: `SELECT username, COUNT(*) FROM users GROUP BY username HAVING COUNT(*) > 1` — fail the migration loudly with a clear message if any duplicates exist (operator decides resolution). No live users yet, so we expect zero.
   - Add a UNIQUE index on `lower(username)` (Postgres expression index for case-insensitive uniqueness).
   - SQLite fallback: plain UNIQUE on the raw column (covers the better-sqlite3 internal-cli test driver — see [`database-migrations.md`](../../architecture/database-migrations.md)).
2. New TypeORM migration: `AddSlugToUsers`.
   - Add nullable `slug` varchar column.
   - Backfill `slug` from `username` (URL-normalize per [spec.md §3.3](spec.md#33-url-safety)) for every existing user.
   - Add UNIQUE index on `lower(slug)`.
   - Flip column to NOT NULL after backfill.
3. New service: `apps/api/src/users/username-allocator.service.ts`.
   - Public method `allocateUsername(base: string): Promise<string>` — runs the existing suffix-on-collision loop in one place. Replace the inline loop in `github-app-onboarding.service.ts:223-229` with a call to this service.
   - Public method `allocateSlug(base: string, ownerTable: 'users' | 'organizations'): Promise<string>` — same loop, checks both `users.slug` and `organizations.slug` for collisions. Used by the eventual Org-create path too.
4. New API endpoint: `GET /api/users/check-username?value=<string>`.
   - Public (`@Public()`).
   - Throttled.
   - Returns `{ available: boolean, suggestion?: string }`.
   - Used by interactive UI signup / settings forms.
5. Update entity: `user.entity.ts` — add `unique: true` to `@Column()` for `username`; add `@Column({ unique: true }) slug: string;` (matches migration).

**Out of scope this phase:** any Tenant / Organization tables; any UI changes; any other entity changes.

**Tests:**
- Unit: `UsernameAllocatorService` handles collisions deterministically.
- Integration: `GET /check-username` returns suggestions and matches subsequent create behavior.
- Migration: dry-run on a snapshot — no duplicates, clean apply.

---

## Phase 1 — Create `tenants` and `organizations` tables

**Goal:** Land the two new tables. Empty on first deploy. No rows are written by this phase.

**Changes:**

1. New entity: `packages/agent/src/entities/tenant.entity.ts`.
   - Columns per [spec.md §1.1](spec.md#11-tenant-internal-only-never-shown-in-ui).
   - Unique index on `ownerUserId`.
   - Unique index on `lower(slug)`.
2. New entity: `packages/agent/src/entities/organization.entity.ts`.
   - Columns per [spec.md §1.2](spec.md#12-organization-user-facing--ui-label-varies).
   - FK `tenantId` → `tenants(id)` ON DELETE CASCADE.
   - FK `linkedWorkId` → `works(id)` ON DELETE SET NULL.
   - Unique index on `lower(slug)` — globally unique across the table.
   - Composite index on `(tenantId, createdAt)` for switcher list queries.
3. New repository: `TenantRepository`, `OrganizationRepository` (under `packages/agent/src/database/`).
4. New TypeORM migration: `CreateTenantsTable`.
5. New TypeORM migration: `CreateOrganizationsTable`.
6. Register both entities in `packages/agent/src/entities/index.ts` and the appropriate ORM module.

**Out of scope this phase:** any FK-back from existing tables to these new tables (that's Phase 2+). No backfill. No API endpoints yet.

**Tests:**
- Schema test: both tables exist, indexes are present, FKs cascade correctly.
- Entity test (alongside existing `work.entity.spec.ts` pattern): constructor + ClassToObject round-trip.

---

## Phase 2 — Add `tenantId` to `users`; add `tenantId` to Tier B entities

**Goal:** Wire the User → Tenant FK and add `tenantId` to all auth-scoped Tier B entities (`tenantId` only — no `organizationId` for these).

**Changes:**

1. New TypeORM migration: `AddTenantIdToUsers`.
   - Add nullable `tenantId uuid` column to `users`.
   - Add FK to `tenants(id)` ON DELETE SET NULL.
   - Add index.
   - **No backfill.** Existing users stay `tenantId = NULL`.
2. New TypeORM migration: `AddTenantIdToTierBEntities`.
   - Adds nullable `tenantId uuid` column + FK + index to each of:
     - `auth_accounts`
     - `auth_sessions`
     - `auth_verifications`
     - `refresh_tokens`
     - `user_template_preferences`
     - `user_task_counters`
   - **No backfill.** Existing rows stay `tenantId = NULL`.
3. Update entities to add the column (`@ManyToOne(() => Tenant, { nullable: true })`).

**Out of scope this phase:** writing `tenantId` on new inserts (that's Phase 5 — only after Tenant rows exist, which only happens after the lazy upgrade flow lands). Until then, `tenantId` stays NULL on all new auth rows too.

---

## Phase 3 — Add `tenantId` + `organizationId` to Tier A entities

**Goal:** Add both columns to all top-level business entities.

**Changes:**

1. One TypeORM migration per entity (following the [`1779977000000-AddWorkOrganizationId.ts`](../../../../apps/api/src/migrations/1779977000000-AddWorkOrganizationId.ts) template):
   - `missions` — add both `tenantId` + `organizationId`, both nullable, both indexed.
   - `work_proposals` (Ideas) — add both.
   - `tasks` — add both.
   - `agents` — add both.
   - `skills` — add both.
   - `conversations` — add both.
   - `notifications` — add both.
   - `api_keys` — add both.
   - `templates` — add both.
   - `template_customizations` — add both.
   - `user_subscriptions` — add both.
   - `work_schedules` — add both.
   - `work_deployments` — add both.
   - `onboarding_requests` — add both.
   - `webhook_subscriptions` — add both.
   - `github_app_installations` — add both.
   - `github_app_user_links` — add both.
   - `works` — add `tenantId` only (`organizationId` already exists; upgrade to FK in Phase 4).
   - `work_knowledge_documents` — add `tenantId` only (`organizationId` already exists; upgrade to FK in Phase 4).
2. For each: update the corresponding entity file to declare the columns.
3. **No backfill** in any of these migrations. Existing rows stay NULL.

**PR scope guidance:** these can all ship in one PR (additive, low risk), or be split into 2–3 PRs grouped by domain (auth/work/agent/task/etc.) if the diff is too big for review. Editor's choice.

**Tests:**
- Per-entity migration test: apply + re-apply is idempotent (matches the existing `hasColumn` guard pattern).
- Entity test: new columns are nullable, optional in `ClassToObject`.

---

## Phase 4 — Upgrade existing free-form `organizationId` columns to FK

**Goal:** Now that `organizations(id)` exists, fix the existing forward-looking columns.

**Changes:**

1. New TypeORM migration: `UpgradeWorkOrganizationIdToFk`.
   - Pre-check: count rows where `organizationId IS NOT NULL` (expect 0 — we haven't created any Orgs in DB yet).
   - If any non-NULL orphan UUIDs exist (no matching `organizations.id`), NULL them out with a logged warning.
   - Add FK constraint `works.organizationId` → `organizations(id)` ON DELETE SET NULL.
2. New TypeORM migration: `UpgradeWorkKnowledgeDocumentOrganizationIdToFk` — same pattern.
3. Update `work.entity.ts` and `work-knowledge-document.entity.ts` to declare the relation (`@ManyToOne(() => Organization, ...)`).

---

## Phase 5 — Tier C children: denormalize `tenantId` (and `organizationId`)

**Goal:** Add denormalized scope columns to all Tier C children (per user-confirmed decision in [spec.md §2.3](spec.md#23-three-tiers-of-entities-which-columns-each-tier-gets)).

**Changes:**

1. One TypeORM migration (or batch — same rationale as Phase 3 splitting):
   - For each Tier C entity, add nullable `tenantId uuid` + FK + index.
   - For Tier C entities whose parent is a Tier A object that *also* has `organizationId`, add nullable `organizationId uuid` + FK + index.
   - **Tier C list:** `conversation_messages`, `task_assignees`, `task_approvers`, `task_reviewers`, `task_watchers`, `task_blocks`, `task_chat_messages`, `task_kb_mentions`, `task_attachments`, `task_relations`, `agent_runs`, `agent_run_logs`, `agent_budgets`, `agent_memberships`, `skill_bindings`, `work_members`, `work_invitations`, `work_generation_history`, `work_knowledge_chunks`, `work_knowledge_citations`, `work_knowledge_tags`, `work_knowledge_uploads`, `webhook_deliveries`, `usage_ledger_entries`, `plugin_usage_events`, `activity_log`.
2. Update each entity to declare the columns.
3. **Service-layer change:** every create path that writes a Tier C row must set `tenantId` and `organizationId` (if the parent has one) from the currently active scope context. This is the largest code change in this phase — ~20–30 services touched.
   - Introduce a `ScopeContext` (request-scoped NestJS provider) carrying `{ tenantId: string | null, organizationId: string | null }`. Resolver middleware (Phase 7) populates it.
   - Update every `Repository.create()` / `Repository.save()` call site for Tier C rows to consume `ScopeContext`.
   - For background jobs / agent ticks / scheduled tasks: extract scope from the parent entity being processed and propagate.
4. **No backfill** in this phase. Existing Tier C rows stay NULL. Backfilled on the user's first-Org-upgrade (Phase 6).

**Risk:** missed service paths leave new rows with `NULL` scope. Mitigation: add a test that asserts new rows created via every service have `tenantId` set when the actor has a Tenant. Lint rule + code review.

---

## Phase 6 — Lazy upgrade flow + Organization-create API

**Goal:** Implement the §5.2 / §5.3 flow — server-side creation of Tenants and Organizations + backfill.

**Changes:**

1. New API endpoints:
   - `POST /api/organizations` — body `{ name, slug? }`. Creates Organization. If user has no Tenant, creates Tenant lazily. Returns the Organization row + scope info.
   - `POST /api/organizations/:id/upgrade-from-account` — moves the user's existing Tier A/B/C rows from Tenant-root into this Organization. Idempotent (only runnable once per user, and only on their first Org).
   - `GET /api/organizations` — list all Orgs for the current user's Tenant.
   - `GET /api/organizations/:slug` — fetch one by slug (used by the slug resolver middleware).
   - `PATCH /api/organizations/:id` — update displayName, legalName, etc.
   - `GET /api/organizations/check-slug?value=<string>` — uniqueness check across `users.slug` + `organizations.slug`.
2. New service: `apps/api/src/organizations/organization.service.ts`.
   - `createOrganization(userId, name, slug?)`:
     1. Lazy-create Tenant if `user.tenantId IS NULL`.
     2. Allocate slug via `UsernameAllocatorService.allocateSlug(name, 'organizations')`.
     3. Insert Organization row.
     4. If `users.lastScopeOrganizationId IS NULL` and this is the user's first Org, store the new Org id on `users.lastScopeOrganizationId` so the next login lands there.
   - `upgradeFromAccount(userId, organizationId)`:
     1. Verify ownership (user owns Tenant; Org belongs to that Tenant).
     2. Verify Org's tenantId matches user's tenantId.
     3. UPDATE every Tier A/B/C row where `userId = X AND tenantId = (user's tenant) AND organizationId IS NULL` → set `organizationId = X`.
     4. This is a transaction; the table list is enumerated in code (one UPDATE per table, all under one DB transaction). On Postgres, set `SET LOCAL statement_timeout = '30s'` for safety.
3. New service: `apps/api/src/scope/scope-context.service.ts` — the request-scoped provider from Phase 5.
4. New service: `apps/api/src/scope/tenant-bootstrap.service.ts` — `ensureTenant(userId): Promise<Tenant>`. Lazy creation logic in one place.

**Tests:**
- Unit: `OrganizationService.createOrganization` handles no-Tenant, has-Tenant, slug-collision, name-empty cases.
- Integration: `POST /api/organizations` end-to-end against an in-memory DB.
- Integration: `upgrade-from-account` moves expected rows, leaves nothing behind, second call is a no-op.

---

## Phase 7 — Slug routing middleware + scope context propagation

**Goal:** Make `/{slug}/...` route shapes work on the API and the web app.

**Changes:**

1. **API (NestJS):**
   - New middleware: `apps/api/src/scope/scope-resolver.middleware.ts`. Reads `:slug` (or `X-Scope-Slug` header for fetch-from-web-client requests), resolves to `{ tenantId, organizationId | null }`, populates `ScopeContext`. 404s on no hit.
   - Apply globally on `/api/*` routes that are scope-sensitive (most of them — exempt list: `/api/auth/*`, `/api/users/check-username`, `/api/organizations/check-slug`).
2. **Web (Next.js App Router):**
   - New segment: `apps/web/src/app/[slug]/...` — mirrors the existing dashboard tree.
   - Slug validated server-side in the layout; on 404, renders a not-found page.
   - Client-side fetcher adds `X-Scope-Slug` header so the API sees the same scope on every call.
3. **Legacy routes** (un-prefixed) — keep them. They resolve to the bare Tenant context for the session's user. Both shapes coexist (additive — NN #20).

**Test surface:**
- E2E: `/{username}/missions` renders the same data as the legacy `/missions` for a user with no Org.
- E2E: `/{orgSlug}/missions` renders only that Org's data; switching the slug in the URL switches the data.
- 404 path: `/notarealsulug/missions` returns 404, not 403, not 500.

---

## Phase 8 — WorkspaceSwitcher UI (sidebar-07 reskin)

**Goal:** Ship the user-facing switcher.

**Changes:**

1. New component: `apps/web/src/components/layout/WorkspaceSwitcher.tsx`.
   - Base: shadcn [`sidebar-07`](https://ui.shadcn.com/blocks#sidebar-07) `TeamSwitcher`, renamed and re-skinned.
   - Reads `organizations` from a SWR hook (`useOrganizations()`) backed by `GET /api/organizations`.
   - Empty state: if `organizations.length === 0`, render the existing `<EverWorksLogo />` component unmodified (no chevron, no popover trigger).
   - Active state: render the switcher chip with avatar + display name + chevron.
   - Popover heading: `"Organizations"` (i18n key TBD — `organizations.switcher.heading`).
   - List item: avatar + display name + check icon for currently active.
   - Footer item: `+ Create Organization` → opens `<CreateOrganizationModal />` (Phase 9).
2. Wire `<WorkspaceSwitcher />` into the existing sidebar layout, replacing the standalone `<EverWorksLogo />` placement. The logo placement keeps showing the logo when zero Orgs exist; it just becomes a switcher chip when 1+ exist.
3. State sync on switch:
   - Clicking an Org row in the popover → POST `/api/users/me/scope` (or PATCH the user row) to persist `lastScopeOrganizationId`; navigate to `/{newSlug}/dashboard`.
   - Clicking the bare-Tenant row (if listed per [spec.md §5.5 option b](spec.md#popover-contents)) → same, with `organizationId = null`; navigate to `/{userSlug}/dashboard`.

**Out of scope this phase:** the Create Organization modal itself (Phase 9 — but Phase 8 still ships the entry point that triggers it; the modal can be a stub for the first PR if the team prefers to ship in two PRs).

---

## Phase 9 — CreateOrganizationModal + upgrade-vs-new dialog

**Goal:** Ship the modal flow from [spec.md §5.2](spec.md#52-user-creates-their-first-organization).

**Changes:**

1. New component: `apps/web/src/components/organizations/CreateOrganizationModal.tsx`.
   - Single input: `Name`.
   - Live slug preview (debounced `GET /api/organizations/check-slug?value=<derivedSlug>`).
   - Submit → POST `/api/organizations` → returns the new Org.
2. New component: `apps/web/src/components/organizations/UpgradeOrCreateDialog.tsx`.
   - Renders *only* if this is the user's first Organization (gate: `(await GET /api/organizations).length === 1`).
   - Two options:
     - **Upgrade current account** (default, pre-selected, focused).
     - **Create with empty data**.
   - Confirm → if "Upgrade", POST `/api/organizations/:id/upgrade-from-account`. If "Empty", do nothing (the Org was already created, it just stays empty).
   - In both branches: navigate to `/{newOrgSlug}/dashboard` and refresh state.
3. Subsequent Org creates (when the user already has 1+ Orgs) skip the dialog entirely — just create + navigate.

**Tests:**
- Unit: `UpgradeOrCreateDialog` defaults to "Upgrade".
- E2E (Playwright): full flow — open switcher, create Org, choose Upgrade, verify existing items show up in new scope.

---

## Phase 10 — Company chip on `+ New` page + Work-of-type-Company → Org wire-up

**Goal:** Make the "Register Company" path (Stripe Atlas etc.) create an Organization on success.

**Changes:**

1. Add `Company` to the chip list on the `+ New` page (per [spec.md §6.3](spec.md#63--new-page--company-chip)). Order: `Mission · Idea · Website · Landing Page · Store · Blog · Directory · Awesome Repo · Knowledge Base · Company`. (Note: `Store` and `Company` were already coming-soon chips in earlier copy — they become real here.)
2. New Work template/type: `Company`. Plumbing follows existing template/type patterns (`Templates` + `WorkType`).
3. New service hook: when a Work of type Company transitions to "registered" status (provider callback or manual marking), the system:
   - Creates an Organization row with `legalName`, `countryCode`, `registrationProvider`, `registrationStatus = 'registered'`, `linkedWorkId = work.id`.
   - Sets `tenantId` to the user's Tenant (lazy-create Tenant if needed).
   - Triggers the `UpgradeOrCreateDialog` flow client-side on the next page load (or via a notification → action handler).
4. The Work itself stays in its original scope. It just gains `organizationId = newOrg.id` so it's visible in the new Org's scope as well as wherever it was created.

---

## Cross-cutting concerns

### Database safety

- All migrations are forward-only and additive (NN #16).
- No DROP / ALTER TYPE / data deletion anywhere.
- Pre-checks at the top of each migration to detect impossible states (e.g. duplicate usernames, orphan `organizationId` UUIDs); fail loud rather than silently corrupting.
- Every PR with a TypeORM entity change ships the corresponding migration in the same PR (NN #16).

### Tests

Each phase ships with:
- Migration tests (apply + revert idempotency).
- Entity tests (round-trip, ClassToObject).
- Service unit tests for new business logic.
- Integration tests for new API endpoints.
- E2E tests for new user-facing flows (Phases 7–10).

The bar: existing 26 agent test suites + 719 tests all keep passing. New phases add their own suites alongside.

### Rollout

- **No feature flag needed for v1.** The columns are added but unused on existing data; the switcher is gated by `organizations.length === 0` (no UI change for users who don't have Orgs). Forward-looking and safe.
- Deploy in phase order. Each phase is a separately mergeable PR. The full work spans Phases 0 → 10.

### CI / release gates

Refer to [`CI_RELEASE_GATES.md`](../../../../../../Workspace/knowledge/runbooks/CI_RELEASE_GATES.md):
- Lightweight CI runs on every PR + release-branch push (typecheck, lint, agent test suite).
- Medium/heavy CI runs on `stage`/`main` pushes only.
- All 10 phase PRs follow the standard `develop → stage → main` cascade (NN #21).

## Sequencing summary

| Phase | Title | Depends on | PR target |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Username uniqueness contract | — | `develop` |
| 1 | Create `tenants` + `organizations` tables | 0 | `develop` |
| 2 | `tenantId` on users + Tier B | 1 | `develop` |
| 3 | `tenantId` + `organizationId` on Tier A | 1 | `develop` |
| 4 | Upgrade existing free-form `organizationId` to FK | 1, 3 | `develop` |
| 5 | Tier C denormalization | 1, 3 | `develop` |
| 6 | Lazy upgrade flow + Organization-create API | 2, 3, 4, 5 | `develop` |
| 7 | Slug routing middleware | 6 | `develop` |
| 8 | WorkspaceSwitcher UI | 6, 7 | `develop` |
| 9 | CreateOrganizationModal + upgrade-vs-new dialog | 6, 7, 8 | `develop` |
| 10 | Company chip + Work→Org wire-up | 6, 7 | `develop` |

Phases 3, 4, 5 can run in parallel after Phase 1. Phases 8, 9, 10 can run in parallel after Phases 6–7. Otherwise, sequential.
